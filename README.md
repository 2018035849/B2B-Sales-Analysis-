## 🚀 **Project Overview**

Over the past month, I’ve worked on the following key areas:

### 🔍 **Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Python**.
- Utilized libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** to manipulate and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 🛠️ **Data Modeling**
- Designed and implemented a **MySQL database** following a **Star Schema Structure** to support efficient querying.
- Created relationships between fact and dimension tables to reflect the B2B sales process.

### 📊 **Data Analysis**
- Utilized **complex SQL queries** with **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions** to explore sales data.
- Extracted valuable insights on sales performance, conversion rates, and customer behaviors.

### 📋 **Report Creation**
- Developed a detailed report in **Power BI**.
- Used **advanced DAX measures** with **Time Intelligence functions** and applied **conditional formatting** to enhance visual storytelling.
- Interactive dashboards and KPIs helped communicate key business metrics.
