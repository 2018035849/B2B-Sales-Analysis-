# 🌟 CRM Sales Opportunities Project

## 📜 Overview

This initiative focuses on the in-depth analysis of B2B sales pipeline data for a hypothetical company specializing in computer hardware. The aim is to extract actionable insights from the sales operations by examining critical aspects such as sales opportunities, product effectiveness, account engagement, and team efficiency.

**🔗 Data Source:** Maven Analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary aims of this project include:

* **💼 Evaluate Sales Team Performance:** How does each sales team stack up against others? Identify the top-performing groups and those needing improvement.

* **👥 Assess Sales Agent Productivity:** Are there agents significantly underperforming? Pinpointing those who may need extra support or training.

* **📈 Spot Trends:** Can we observe any quarter-over-quarter trends? Discover patterns in sales performance over time.

* **🏆 Analyze Product Success Rates:** Which products boast higher win rates? Investigate which offerings excel in closing deals.

A personal goal of this project is to enhance my ability to craft complex SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions, alongside advancing my skills in developing intricate DAX measures and dynamic dashboards in Power BI.
